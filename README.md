# python-calculator

Very basic walkthrough of Python scripting.

## Usage

You can execute the Python script via command-line (CLI).

```shell
python calc.py <method_name> <variable_1> <variable_2>
```

## Tasks

- Implement subtraction, division, and any other calculations.
- Refactor this into a class implementation.
- Make the script more "interactive" - users shouldn't have to memorize the method names.
